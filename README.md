# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element outside of its valid index range. The solution (`bugSolution.java`) shows how to correct this issue by ensuring that array access is within the bounds of the array's length.
